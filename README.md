# send_simple_report

This is an old implementation of a simple report generation and auto send as email to partners/intended recipients, which I just came across and thought to upload.

I will eventually add the preceeding aspect of running the sql script against an RDBMS system to store the file in a csv/txt format - that was my thought process at the time this was implemented for partners at an old job.

I will update as I keep learning...
